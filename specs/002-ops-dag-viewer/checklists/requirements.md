# Specification Quality Checklist: 运维任务流 DAG 查看器

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass on first validation.
- Spec is ready for `speckit-clarify` or `speckit-plan`.
- The feature has a clear, bounded scope: read-only published-DAG viewer in a modal, for both periodic and manual workflow lists in the Ops Center.
- No clarification needed — all reasonable defaults were applied from existing codebase patterns (dialog UX from `@base-ui/react/dialog`, DAG rendering from `@xyflow/react`, ops list structure from existing panels).
