# Specification Quality Checklist: 工作流实例运维操作

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- 所有检查项通过。规格中保留的状态名（如 RUNNING/FAILED/STOPPED）和实体属性名属于该领域的基础概念，非实现细节。
- Key Entities 节描述的是"存在哪些数据"而非"如何存储"，符合规格层面的抽象程度。
- 规格可直接进入 `/speckit-clarify` 或 `/speckit-plan` 阶段。
